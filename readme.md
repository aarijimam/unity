This SDK is a wrapper over PlayroomKit JS. Currently, it only supports WebGL exported games. The API is meant to closely mirror the PlayroomKit JavaScript SDK.

<!-- Start SDK Installation -->
## Installation and Usage

See [PlayroomKit Unity docs](https://docs.joinplayroom.com/usage/unity) on how to use this SDK in your Unity project.


This beta version of the SDK might undergo changes that could break compatibility with previous versions, even without a major version update. To ensure stability, it's advisable to fix the usage to a particular package version. By doing so, you'll consistently install the same version and avoid unexpected changes, unless you deliberately seek the latest updates.
